I found that working with proper maths was easier for this question.

2520 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7

2520 contains the prime factors needed for each of the numbers from 1 -> 10's prime factors.
E.g:

4 = 2^2 (2520 contains 2^3 so that's ok)
7 = 7 (2520 contains 7)
8 = 2^3 (2520 contains 2^3)

Following this logic I just need to find the extra stuff I needed to add onto 2520.

2520 * 2 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 232792560 (wow big number)
